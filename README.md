### GayMods Repo for Kodi/XBMC Gay Adult Addons
**https://github.com/moedje/kodi-repo-gaymods**

### REQUIRED TO WORK: OAuth from Tumblr
You need to authorize the app with Tumblr to your account so we can retrieve your following, liked, dashboard, etc. I do not have an easy way to do this in Kodi yet and I am working on this. For now you have to do this with a browser that you are logged into tumblr simply visit:

#### https://api.tumblr.com/console/calls/user/info
Consumer Key: **5wEwFCF0rbiHXYZQQeQnNetuwZMmIyrUxIePLqUMcZlheVXwc4**

Consumer Secret: **GCLMI2LnMZqO2b5QheRvUSYY51Ujk7nWG2sYroqozW06x4hWch**

Tumblr will give you back an **OAUTH_TOKEN and OAUTH_SECRET** you need to put this into the addon's settings and then it will work. If anyone knows how to make this work easier from within Kodi that would be most helpful!!
